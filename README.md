# Silent Failure in Dart Async Function: Missing `rethrow`

This example demonstrates a common error in Dart async functions: failing to properly handle and propagate exceptions.  Without `rethrow`, exceptions caught within the `catch` block are silently ignored, leading to unexpected behavior and making debugging difficult.

## Bug
The `fetchData` function attempts to fetch data from an API.  If an error occurs, the exception is caught but not rethrown. This means that the calling function won't be notified of the failure, potentially leading to a program continuing to run with incorrect or missing data.

## Solution
The solution involves adding `rethrow` to the `catch` block. This re-throws the caught exception, allowing it to be handled further up the call stack.  This enables more robust error handling and prevents silent failures.
